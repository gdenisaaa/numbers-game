A simple and fun JavaScript game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number!

🕹️ How it works:
- the computer secretly chooses a number between 1 and 20;
- you type your guess and get instant feedback — too high, too low, or correct!
- each wrong guess decreases your score;
- try to guess the correct number before your score hits zero!

🔥 Features:
- dynamic feedback messages;
- score and high score tracking;
- simple, responsive UI;
- restart button to play again instantly.
